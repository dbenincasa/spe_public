\section{Introduction}
We write a brief paper meant to support \href{http://www.mhpc.it/}{MHPC} 
lectures on scientific programming environment. The goal of this classes 
is to provide students scientific programming tools to develop scientific applications. 
The author is an engineer, with a Ph.D. in numerical analysis and hopefully these brief 
notes will hold the best habits of these two education paths. Achieving my goal no 
matter what, and in the most efficient way. Being passionate about sophisticated 
mathematical structures. Finite Elements is method that allows me to express my passion 
about mathematics, and meanwhile teach best programming practices. I apologise 
I can't teach programming something that does not stimulate my curiosity.

\section{Strong Problem}
Scientists solve problems. Among the pletora of existing problems 
we need to pick one, simple enough to be solved during te time dedicated to a single 
class, and sophisticated enough to be representative for more sophisticated ones. 
The answer is the Poisson's problem,
modeling the diffusion of temperature in a body.

Given a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2$.
Find $u$ such that:
\[
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
-\Delta u = f & \mathrm{in}\ \Omega \\
u = 0  & \mathrm{on}\ \partial\Omega
\end{array}
\right.
\]
Just one remark:
\[
\Delta u = \partial_{xx} u + \partial_{yy} u,
\]
where $x$ and $y$ are the two coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

In other words, the Poisson's problem is asking for a type of solution 
that is characterised by having two continuous derivatives, in mathematical 
sense we ask for $u\in C^2$. \emph{It can be proved} that such a solution exists and 
is unique. It is also true that such a solution can be \emph{found} in simple and
specific cases. In the next section we explore an alternative strategy.

\section{Continous Weak Problem}
In the previous section we looked at the Poisson's problem and noticed that searching 
for its solution in a strong form requires looking for a $C^2$ solution. This requirement 
is that strong, that can only be fulfilled in simple cases. 
The Finite Element (Method) si not really a method, it is rather the art of looking 
for solutions in vector spaces simpler than the one needed by the strong form.

We understand that a key role is played by the space $V$ substituting 
the $C^2$ space. Assuming $V$ is continuous (has an infinite set of basis 
functions) the first idea is to project the problem onto this particular space. 
Mathematically this is written as:
\[
-\int_\Omega \Delta u\, v = \int_\Omega f\, v \quad \forall v \in V
\]
If the projection procedure in functional spaces looks cryptical,
we can compare it to the geometrical projection. Consider $u$ a vector 
and $V$ the $\mathbb{R}^2$ space. The projection of $u$ onto $V$ is:
\[
u = u_1 \cdot \mathbf{e}_1 + u_2 \cdot \mathbf{e}_2,
\]
being $\mathbf{e}_1$, $\mathbf{e}_2$ the basis vectors for $V = \mathbb{R}^2$.
The analogy here should be clear once we think that $\mathbf{e}_i$ play the 
same role as $v$.  

If we want to really get rid of the second derivatives in our problem we can 
integrate by parts:
\[
\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v - 
\int_{\partial \Omega} u \,\nabla v \cdot \mathbf{n} = \int_\Omega f\, v.
\]
The boundary integral calls for the boundary conditions to come into play. 
Homogenous boundary conditions require $u=0\ \mathrm{on}\ \partial\Omega$.
This requirement has a very simple meaning: ``we do not need to project our solution
on the boundary'', as consequence: $v=0\ \mathrm{on}\ \partial\Omega$.
%term looks more nasty than it actually is. 
%Nevertheless we have picked a problem simple enough to postpone the 
%discussion on boundary conditions. On the boundary integral we have just
%the same flux term that we asked to be zero at the boundary, meaning, our 
%integral goes to zero.
We are left with:
\[
\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v = \int_\Omega f\, v.
\]

For simplicity, we look for $u$ in the very same space as $v$. 
Notice that this is a choice that works pretty well in this case, but
remember, Finite Elements is an art, not a method. This choice 
is arbitrary and there are cases in which this choice fails. 
The weak formulation 
of our original problem, looks like:

Find $u\in V$, such that:
\[
\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v = \int_\Omega f\, v, \quad \forall v \in V.
\]

The relation between the weak problem and the strong one 
is clarified by the Lax-Milgram theorem. This proofs 
that the weak form is equivalent to the strong one, meaning 
we can approximate the continuous weak problem to get the solution 
of the strong one. We conclude this section recalling that:
\[
\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v = \int_\Omega 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\partial_x u\\
\partial_y u\\
\end{array}
\right) \cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
\partial_x v\\
\partial_y v\\
\end{array}
\right) = 
\int_\Omega \left(
\partial_x u\, \partial_x v + 
\partial_y u\, \partial_y v\right)
\]

\section{Discrete Weak Problem}

To plug the solution of the Poisson's problem inside a computer 
we need to discretise it. F. Brezzi has a very nice way to explain 
the relation between the continuous form and the discrete one:
``Just plug $h$ everywhere!''

Find $u_h\in V_h$, such that:
\[
\int_\Omega \nabla u_h \cdot \nabla v_h = \int_\Omega f\, v_h, \quad \forall v_h \in V_h.
\]

Of course the this graphical operation has some deep mathematical consequences
that are explained in a very elegant way by the C\'ea's Lemma. We express the 
meaning of this lemma with the sketch in Figure~\ref{fig:cea_lemma}. If $V_h$ is a two dimensional plane and $u$ a point in three dimensions. The distance between $u$ and $u_h$ is the minimal among the all possible distances 
between $u$ and any $v_h$.

between $u$ and any $v_h$.}

The first step toward the discretisation of the problem, is the discretisation 
of the domain. In Figure~\ref{fig:mesh} we represent the domain $\Omega$ and its 
discretisation, namely the triangulation $\mathcal{T}_h$ .
